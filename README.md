# pyvidtracker
A Video Player with tracking and graphing features, written in Python and Tkinter.

## Features
- Playing any videos, such as .mp4 files
- Clean GUI (play/pause, frame skipping, start/end)
- "Tracking" mode; clicking on the video frame by frame allows you to register the position of your clicks.
